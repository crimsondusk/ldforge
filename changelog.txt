=================================================
== Changes in version 1.1
=================================================

- Added a progress dialog for file loading to respond to desktops while loading files. With large files
	the no-response policy could be a bad thing.
- Added Export To File action, moved it + insert from to File menu
- Fixed: text editing did not trigger checks while setting LDraw path, removed the Configure
	button from the LDraw path config dialog, it's no longer needed.
- Fixed: Coordinates weren't drawn properly on a bright background (was always drawn in bright colors..).
- Parts are now zoomed to fit properly
- Added ability to snap to pre-existing vertices while drawing.
- Replace coords: allow replacing all coords regardless of original value, plus relative moving (offset)
